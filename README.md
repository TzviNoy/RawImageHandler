Summary:

In this project I opened raw images which were saved in ".raw" files.
I cleaned the data, and processed it with classic image processing methods.
In addition, in ordere to practice and improve my PyTorch abilities, I trained a simple 3 layers FC neural network
which learned to map 16 bits binary representation of my raw data into single value. 
Pictures which were passed through the net ended up looking similar to the pictures which were handled with classic methods.
